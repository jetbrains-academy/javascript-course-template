This task demonstrates how to test a React project. For more details, refer to `test/test.jsx`.

Just like with the backend, all dependencies are installed from the main `package.json` 
file located in the root of the project when the course is opened.

The `package.json` file provided in this task allows students to manually run the project and understand its setup.
From the student’s perspective, each task operates as a standalone project.
