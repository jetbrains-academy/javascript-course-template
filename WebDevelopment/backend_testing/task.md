This task demonstrates how to test a Node.js project. For more details, refer to `test/test.js`.

All dependencies are installed from the main `package.json` file located in the root of the project when the course is opened.

The `package.json` file provided in this task allows students to manually run the project and understand its setup. 
From the student’s perspective, each task operates as a standalone project.

Student can click ![](images/run.svg) next to the `start` script in the IDE interface to run the project:
<div style="text-align: center; width:60%; max-width: 500px;">
<img src="images/script_start.png" alt="package.json script start block">
</div>

<style>
img {
  display: inline !important;
}
</style>
